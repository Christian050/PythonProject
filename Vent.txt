i guess its easier to use the keyboard without looking at it much when you use it frequently

Anyway
todays the first time im talking about how my day went,
on notepad.

mmh, its been bittersweet yk, i still think about you know who.Frankly i wish i dont,
i wanna move on from all this (i still got problems using the keyboard lol) and my narcissistic side wants
ykw to see how much ive gotten over it.I dont have anyone to talk to about this and thats because i dont trust nobody.
its something ive told myself long since, probably cause i think im weird and alla that but its like i dont wanna deal with nobody
but at the same time i wanna be surrounded by people and have fun. I think i come off as cold and distant, i like it but i want people to know that ion bite.
anyway, back to the story, i feel something for her, i just dont know why and how to stop it. When she said she only saw me as a friend, i didnt think of it as much but i
did feel some type of way (hurt maybe) and stalking, well kinda,i dont think it fits the description but yeah i want her to see how unfazed i am and how much ive moved on from her.
At this point if she offered a relationship, i'll have to decline, not like i "have to" but i think i should so i focus on myself,if she moves on, cool, if i find one in the US, cool, but
i think i need to focus on myself.I remember how relieved i was when she told me she didnt like me tho, just saying
i need to go so maybe later
(if im not lazy lol)
